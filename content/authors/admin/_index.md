Welcome to the USDA ARS HCRU lab in Corvallis, Oregon. We combine basic tools from genomics, epidemiology and bioinformatics, with translational research approaches to strategically address some of the fundamental challenges posed by plant diseases caused by the genus _Phytophthora_.

Specifically, our team is interested in the epidemiology, genetics and evolution of exotic and reemerging _Phytophthora_ species. The genus _Phytophthora_ contains most destructive plant pathogens affecting agricultural and forest crops. Important examples include _P. ramorum_, a devastating exotic pathogen causing sudden oak death, and _P. infestans_, known as the cause of the Irish potato famine. Much of our work is conducted with a focus on translational applications towards improving disease management in agriculture.
