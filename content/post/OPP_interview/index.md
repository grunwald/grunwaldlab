title: 'Open Plant Pathology (OPP) interview'
subtitle: 'Great honor to be interviewed by OPP :thumbsup:'
summary: __OPP__ provides a series of interviews with scientists in __Plant Pathology__ or related areas who have embraced open science and contributed knowledge and tools to advance the field. OPP is a community of plant pathologists, mostly computationally-oriented, that supports  several forms of Open Science practices. We support efforts from individuals or groups to develop and deliver next-generation databases and tools for plant pathology-related subjects and applications using open source software, data and repositories.
