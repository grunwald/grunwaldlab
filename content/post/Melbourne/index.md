I was honored to be invited to present our research on translational applications of genomics to manage _Phytophthora_ pathogens at the workshop convened in Melbourne, Australia by Biosecurity Queensland of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The workshop provided me with a deep appreciation for all the excellent work being done in Australia.
