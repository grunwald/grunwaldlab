:clap: Congratulations to [**Zach Foster**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A_KrMroAAAAJ&hl=en), who graduated with a Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology :rocket: from Oregon State University. Zach has been very productive producing two R packages, [metacoder](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005404) and [taxa](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.14013.2) as well as publishing several papers before his defense. We could not be prouder of you!

Here he is at the recent **Plant Health** meeting in Tampa, FL presenting his innovative visualization for microbiome data we call heat trees and implemented in the `metacoder` R package:

Zach has given numerous presentations nationally and internationally on analyzing microbiome data in R.
