Zach Foster won the t-shirt design [competition](https://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2018/06/29/plos-computational-biology-t-shirt-design-winner-announced-2/) conducted over twitter by PLoS Computational Biology with his differential heat-tree design. Heat-trees show differential abundance of OTUs across two pairwise comparisons in a hierarchical, tree-based format. The heat-tree concept was first introduced in our paper on the R package *metacoder* [paper](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005404) and the winning design for the t-shirt is inspired by figure 5. 

This t-shirt was given away at the [ISMB 2018](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018) conference in Chicago. 

We are now all proudly wearing his design:
