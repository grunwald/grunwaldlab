We welcome Dr. Andrew Tupper to our group. Andrew graduated with a PhD degree in Biochemistry and Astrobiology from McMaster University in Hamilton, ON, Canada. He previously received his BS in Interdisciplinary Studies from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. Andrew has published research with intriguing titles such as 'Can the RNA World Still Function without
Cytidine?' 

Andrew joins our group to conduct comparative genomic analyses of _Phytophthora ramorum_ and close relatives.
