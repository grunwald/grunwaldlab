We warmly welcome a cluster hire of four postdocs to collaborate on developing novel approaches for tracing pathogens and microbiomes using whole genome sequences, transcriptomics and population/comparative genomics. This is a joint effort with Jared LeBoldus and Jeff Chang at Oregon State University.
