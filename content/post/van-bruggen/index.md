[**Ariena H. C. van Bruggen**](http://www.epi.ufl.edu/people/faculty-profiles/ariena-h-c-van-bruggen/), my PhD mentor, retires from the University of Florida. I was lucky to be able to participate in her memorable retirement symposium entitled [**Microbial Cycling in Food Webs**](http://www.epi.ufl.edu/people/faculty-profiles/ariena-h-c-van-bruggen/). The symposium was a resounding success and we all wish Ariena the best in retirement.
