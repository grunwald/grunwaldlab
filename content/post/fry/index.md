[**Bill Fry**](https://pppmb.cals.cornell.edu/people/william-fry), my postdoctoral mentor, finally retired from Cornell's SIPS. He hosted all his lab members for a memorable party. I learned a lot from Bill in terms of conducting research, project management, networking, service to our institutions and field, and how to conduct research. Thanks Bill, for your kind and deep mentorship.
