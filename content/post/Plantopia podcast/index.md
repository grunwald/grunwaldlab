summary: Healthy plants are the foundation for life on our planet. They produce the oxygen we breathe and over 80% of the food we eat. The __Plantopia__ podcast series explains how protecting plant health can ensure a sustainable future. Inspired by the United Nations declaration of 2020 as the International Year of Plant Health, the American Phytopathological Society created Plantopia so you can explore the world of plant health in company with plant pathologistsâ€”people on a mission to protect plants and our food supply.
