    abstract = { Diseases have a significant cost to agriculture. Findings from analyses of whole-genome sequences show great promise for informing strategies to mitigate risks from diseases caused by phytopathogens. Genomic approaches can be used to dramatically shorten response times to outbreaks and inform disease management in novel ways. However, the use of these approaches requires expertise in working with big, complex data sets and an understanding of their pitfalls and limitations to infer well-supported conclusions. We suggest using an evolutionary framework to guide the use of genomic approaches in epidemiology and diagnostics of plant pathogens. We also describe steps that are necessary for realizing these as standard approaches in disease surveillance. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Phytopathology, Volume 59 is August 2021. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates. }

  abstract = { Effectors are small, secreted proteins that facilitate infection of host plants by all major groups of plant pathogens. Effector protein identification in oomycetes relies on identification of open reading frames with certain amino acid motifs among additional minor criteria. To date, identification of effectors relies on custom scripts to identify motifs in candidate open reading frames. Here, we developed the R package effectR that provides a convenient tool for rapid prediction of effectors in oomycete genomes, or with custom scripts for any genome, in a reproducible way. The effectR package relies on a combination of regular expressions statements and hidden Markov model approaches to predict candidate RxLR and CRN effectors. Other custom motifs for novel effectors can easily be implemented and added to package updates. The effectR package has been validated with published oomycete genomes. This package provides a convenient tool for wetlab researchers interested in reproducible identification of candidate effectors in oomycete genomes. }

  ABSTRACT={Modulation of gene expression through RNA interference is well conserved in eukaryotes and is involved in many cellular processes. In the oomycete Phytophthora, research on the small RNA machinery and function has started to reveal potential roles in the pathogen, but much is still unknown. We examined Argonaute (AGO) homologs within oomycetes, especially among Phytophthora species, to gain a clearer understanding of the evolution of this well-conserved protein family. We identified AGO homologs across many representative oomycete and stramenopile species, and annotated representative homologs in P. sojae. Furthermore, we demonstrate variable expression levels of all identified AGO homologs in comparison to previously identified Dicer-like (DCL) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) homologs. Our phylogenetic analysis further refines the relationship of the AGO homologs in oomycetes and identifies a conserved tandem duplication of AGO homologs in a subset of Phytophthora species.}

	abstract = {Rathayibacter toxicus is a species of Gram-positive, corynetoxin-producing bacteria that causes annual ryegrass toxicity, a disease often fatal to grazing animals. A phylogenomic approach was employed to model the evolution of R.~toxicus to explain the low genetic diversity observed among isolates collected during a 30-year period of sampling in three regions of Australia, gain insight into the taxonomy of Rathayibacter, and provide a framework for studying these bacteria. Analyses of a data set of more than 100 sequenced Rathayibacter genomes indicated that Rathayibacter forms nine species-level groups. R. toxicus is the most genetically distant, and evidence suggested that this species experienced a dramatic event in its evolution. Its genome is significantly reduced in size but is colinear to those of sister species. Moreover, R.~toxicus has low intergroup genomic diversity and almost no intragroup genomic diversity between ecologically separated isolates. R.~toxicus is the only species of the genus that encodes a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) locus and that is known to host a bacteriophage parasite. The spacers, which represent a chronological history of infections, were characterized for information on past events. We propose a three-stage process that emphasizes the importance of the bacteriophage and CRISPR in the genome reduction and low genetic diversity of the R.~toxicus species.IMPORTANCE Rathayibacter toxicus is a toxin-producing species found in Australia and is often fatal to grazing animals. The threat of introduction of the species into the United States led to its inclusion in the Federal Select Agent Program, which makes R.~toxicus a highly regulated species. This work provides novel insights into the evolution of R.~toxicus. R.~toxicus is the only species in the genus to have acquired a CRISPR adaptive immune system to protect against bacteriophages. Results suggest that coexistence with the bacteriophage NCPPB3778 led to the massive shrinkage of the R.~toxicus genome, species divergence, and the maintenance of low genetic diversity in extant bacterial groups. This work contributes to an understanding of the evolution and ecology of an agriculturally important species of bacteria.},

  abstract={Over the past few years, symptoms akin to late blight disease have been reported on a variety of crop plants in South America. Despite the economic importance of these crops, the causal agents of the diseases belonging to the genus Phytophthora have not been completely characterized. In this study, a new Phytophthora species was described in Colombia from tree tomato (Solanum betaceum), a semi-domesticated fruit grown in northern South America. Comprehensive phylogenetic, morphological, population genetic analyses, and infection assays to characterize this new species, were conducted. All data support the description of the new species, Phytophthora betacei sp. nov. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that this new species belongs to clade 1c of the genus Phytophthora and is a close relative of the potato late blight pathogen, P. infestans. Furthermore, it appeared as the sister group of the P. andina strains collected from wild Solanaceae (clonal lineage EC-2). Analyses of morphological and physiological characters as well as host specificity showed high support for the differentiation of these species. Based on these results, a complete description of the new species is provided and the species boundaries within Phytophthora clade 1c in northern South America are discussed.},

It was first isolated in 2008 but had previously been recovered from tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) and Douglas‐fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees in Oregon, USA in 2002. Phytophthora pluvialis was subsequently described as a new species in 2013 and classified as a clade III Phytophthora species. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the genetic diversity, population structure and origin of this pathogen. A total of 360 P. pluvialis isolates were collected from the USA and New Zealand. The genome sequences of two P. pluvialis isolates were used to identify 27 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that were then used to genotype the two populations. The genotypic data showed that the USA population of P. pluvialis had twice the genetic diversity and a greater number of multilocus genotypes (MLGs) compared to the New Zealand population, with 126 and 24 MLGs, respectively. The majority of the subpopulations within the USA and New Zealand showed linkage disequilibrium. All subpopulations had a negative fixation index, indicating that clonal reproduction is prevalent in both countries. A minimum spanning network (MSN) showed two unique clusters of isolates in the New Zealand population, suggesting two potential introductions of P. pluvialis into New Zealand from the USA. There was no significant structure within the New Zealand or USA populations. This study provides novel insight into the genetic structure of P. pluvialis in New Zealand and the USA.},

  abstract ={Background: The interaction between oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora sojae and soybean is characterized by the presence of avirulence (Avr) genes in P. sojae, which encode for effectors that trigger immune responses and resistance in soybean via corresponding resistance genes (Rps). A recent survey highlighted a rapid diversification of P. sojae Avr genes in soybean fields and the need to deploy new Rps genes. However, the full genetic diversity of P. sojae isolates remains complex and dynamic and is mostly characterized on the basis of phenotypic associations with differential soybean lines.

  Results:
  We sequenced the genomes of 31 isolates of P. sojae, representing a large spectrum of the pathotypes found in soybean fields, and compared all the genetic variations associated with seven Avr genes (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1k, 3a, 6) and how the derived haplotypes matched reported phenotypes in 217 interactions. We discovered new variants, copy number variations and some discrepancies with the virulence of previously described isolates with Avr genes, notably with Avr1b and Avr1c. In addition, genomic signatures revealed 11.5% potentially erroneous phenotypes. When these interactions were re-phenotyped, and the Avr genes re-sequenced over time and analyzed for expression, our results showed that genomic signatures alone accurately predicted 99.5% of the interactions.

  Conclusions:
  This comprehensive genomic analysis of seven Avr genes of P. sojae in a population of 31 isolates highlights that genomic signatures can be used as accurate predictors of phenotypes for compatibility with Rps genes in soybean. Our findings also show that spontaneous mutations, often speculated as a source of aberrant phenotypes, did not occur within the confines of our experiments and further suggest that epigenesis or gene silencing do not account alone for previous discordance between genotypes and phenotypes. Furthermore, on the basis of newly identified virulence patterns within Avr1c, our results offer an explanation why Rps1c has failed more rapidly in the field than the reported information on virulence pathotypes.},

  abstrac = {Inference of copy number variation presents a technical challenge because variant callers typically require the copy number of a genome or genomic region to be known a priori. Here we present a method to infer copy number that uses variant call format (VCF) data as input and is implemented in the R package vcfR. This method is based on the relative frequency of each allele (in both genic and non-genic regions) sequenced at heterozygous positions throughout a genome. These heterozygous positions are summarized by using arbitrarily sized windows of heterozygous positions, binning the allele frequencies, and selecting the bin with the greatest abundance of positions. This provides a non-parametric summary of the frequency that alleles were sequenced at. The method is applicable to organisms that have reference genomes that consist of full chromosomes or sub-chromosomal contigs. In contrast to other software designed to detect copy number variation, our method does not rely on an assumption of base ploidy, but instead infers it. We validated these approaches with the model system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and applied it to the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, both known to vary in copy number. This functionality has been incorporated into the current release of the R package vcfR to provide modular and flexible methods to investigate copy number variation in genomic projects.},

  abstract={We are entering a new era in plant pathology in which whole-genome sequences of many individuals of a pathogen species are becoming readily available. Population genomics aims to discover genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypes associated with adaptive traits such as pathogenicity, virulence, fungicide resistance, and host specialization, as genome sequences or large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms become readily available from multiple individuals of the same species. This emerging field encompasses detailed genetic analyses of natural populations, comparative genomic analyses of closely related species, identification of genes under selection, and linkage analyses involving association studies in natural populations or segregating populations resulting from crosses. The era of pathogen population genomics will provide new opportunities and challenges, requiring new computational and analytical tools. This review focuses on conceptual and methodological issues as well as the approaches to answering questions in population genomics. The major steps start with defining relevant biological and evolutionary questions, followed by sampling, genotyping, and phenotyping, and ending in analytical methods and interpretations. We provide examples of recent applications of population genomics to fungal and oomycete plant pathogens.}

  abstract = {Abstract Software to call single‐nucleotide polymorphisms or related genetic variants has converged on the variant call format (VCF) as the output format of choice. This has created a need for tools to work with VCF files. While an increasing number of software exists to read VCF data, many only extract the genotypes without including the data associated with each genotype that describes its quality. We created the r package vcfr to address this issue. We developed a VCF file exploration tool implemented in the r language because r provides an interactive experience and an environment that is commonly used for genetic data analysis. Functions to read and write VCF files into r as well as functions to extract portions of the data and to plot summary statistics of the data are implemented. vcfr further provides the ability to visualize how various parameterizations of the data affect the results. Additional tools are included to integrate sequence (fasta) and annotation data (GFF) for visualization of genomic regions such as chromosomes. Conversion functions translate data from the vcfr data structure to formats used by other r genetics packages. Computationally intensive functions are implemented in C++ to improve performance. Use of these tools is intended to facilitate VCF data exploration, including intuitive methods for data quality control and easy export to other r packages for further analysis. vcfr thus provides essential, novel tools currently not available in r.},

  abstract = {The potato late blight pathogen was introduced to Europe in the 1840s and caused the devastating loss of a staple crop, resulting in the Irish potato famine and subsequent diaspora. Research on this disease has engendered much debate, which in recent years has focused on whether the geographic origin of the pathogen is South America or central Mexico. Different lines of evidence support each hypothesis. We sequenced four nuclear genes in representative samples from Mexico and the South American Andes. An Andean origin of P. infestans does not receive support from detailed analyses of Andean and Mexican populations. This is one of a few examples of a pathogen with a known origin that is secondary to its current major host.},

  abstract = {Phytophthora plant pathogens contain many hundreds of effectors potentially involved in infection of host plants. Comparative genomic analyses have shown that these effectors evolve rapidly and have been subject to recent expansions. We examined the recent sequence evolution of RXLR-class effector gene families in the sudden oak death pathogen, P. ramorum. We found that P. ramorum RXLR effectors have taken multiple evolutionary paths, including loss or gain of repeated domains, recombination or gene conversion among paralogs, and selection on point mutations. Sequencing of homologs from two subfamilies in P. ramorum’s closest known relatives revealed repeated gene duplication and divergence since speciation with P. lateralis. One family showed strong signatures of recombination while the other family has evolved primarily by point mutation. Comparison of a small number of the hundreds of RXLR-class effectors across three clonal lineages of P. ramorum shows striking divergence in alleles among lineages, suggesting the potential for functional differences between lineages. Our results suggest future avenues for examination of rapidly evolving effectors in P. ramorum, including investigation of the functional and coevolutionary significance of the patterns of sequence evolution that we observed.},

  abstract={Recently introduced, exotic plant pathogens may exhibit low genetic diversity and be limited to clonal reproduction. However, rapidly mutating molecular markers such as microsatellites can reveal genetic variation within these populations and be used to model putative migration patterns. Phytophthora ramorum is the exotic pathogen, discovered in the late 1990s, that is responsible for sudden oak death in California forests and ramorum blight of common ornamentals. The nursery trade has moved this pathogen from source populations on the West Coast to locations across the United States, thus risking introduction to other native forests. We examined the genetic diversity of P. ramorum in United States nurseries by microsatellite genotyping 279 isolates collected from 19 states between 2004 and 2007. Of the three known P. ramorum clonal lineages, the most common and genetically diverse lineage in the sample was NA1. Two eastward migration pathways were revealed in the clustering of NA1 isolates into two groups, one containing isolates from Connecticut, Oregon, and Washington and the other isolates from California and the remaining states. This finding is consistent with trace forward analyses conducted by the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. At the same time, genetic diversities in several states equaled those observed in California, Oregon, and Washington and two-thirds of multilocus genotypes exhibited limited geographic distributions, indicating that mutation was common during or subsequent to migration. Together, these data suggest that migration, rapid mutation, and genetic drift all play a role in structuring the genetic diversity of P. ramorum in US nurseries. This work demonstrates that fast-evolving genetic markers can be used to examine the evolutionary processes acting on recently introduced pathogens and to infer their putative migration patterns, thus showing promise for the application of forensics to plant pathogens.},
